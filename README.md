## Management System for Hill & Knowlton
### Overview

This repository contains the codebase and documentation for the BSc Computer Science tasks related to the development of a Knowledge Management System (KMS) for Hill & Knowlton, incorporating RabbitMQ as a message broker. The case study provides insight into the challenges faced by the company in implementing a successful KMS and the steps taken to address those challenges, leveraging RabbitMQ to enhance the system's capabilities.

### Case Study Background

Hill & Knowlton, a global public relations firm, recognized the need for an effective Knowledge Management System in 1999. The existing system was underutilized, and employees cited issues such as outdated information and a lack of user-friendliness. The company aimed to enhance knowledge sharing, streamline project information, and improve overall accessibility.

### Project Objectives

        The primary objectives of this project, now enhanced with RabbitMQ integration, are as follows:

1. Develop a new portal-type Extranet named hk.net for Hill & Knowlton.
2. Address the challenges faced by the existing system, ensuring data accuracy, relevance, and ease of use.
3. Implement RabbitMQ as a message broker to facilitate communication and decouple microservices within the system.
4. Implement a system for organizing and searching through project-related emails efficiently.
5. Capture and categorize essential knowledge in three key areas: internal knowledge, external knowledge, and client knowledge.
6. Customize the Extranet for each client, providing a personalized experience.
7. Intraspect Software (Salsa package): Utilized for storing and indexing project-related emails.
8. Micro-payment system ("beenz"): Implemented to encourage user engagement and reward contributions.
9. Various web technologies: Employed to create the Extranet and ensure accessibility.

### Project Challenges

        1. Data Connectivity: Faced challenges due to varying data speeds in different locations. Partial solutions were implemented, but the issue remained in certain offices.
2. User Adoption: Encountered resistance from employees and clients to use the system routinely. Training and incentives were introduced to overcome this challenge.

### Key Features

        1. Email Organization: Implemented a solution for organizing and searching through project-related emails efficiently.
2. Customization: Tailored hk.net for each client, allowing personalized access to relevant information.
3. Incentive System: Introduced bonuses, recognition, and micro-payments to encourage user engagement and contributions.
4. RabbitMQ Integration: Implemented RabbitMQ as a message broker for enhanced communication and scalability.
